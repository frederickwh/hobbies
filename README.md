<h1>My personal hobbies and interests</h1>

<b>The first and definitely the most significant hobby I would like to share is my love for fitness and well-being. In 2017 I was involved in a car accident which left me with significant nerve damage to my back and hips. The injury has had a profound impact on my life, not only in the workplace but also in my personal life. To promote healing and to create a happy and fulfilling life despite my disability, I've turned to fitness and well-being as a meaningful way of overcoming and adapting to these unfortunate cards’ life has dealt me. I’m proud to say that I have not let an injury such as this consume me, and I deal with it well. I try to stretch often, strengthen the most important areas of my core, and swim when I get the chance to. These activities have helped me regain control over the pain and strengthen the affected areas.

Pursuing fitness and well-being has not only benefited me physically but also mentally. It’s my positive outlet in dealing with the stress and anxiety which comes with living with a chronic injury. Throughout this very personal journey I have learned firsthand how inextricably linked the mind and body are. Staying positive through what at times has felt impossible, has given me a deep perspective, understanding, and unique appreciation for life.

While this experience has presented hurdles, I’ve developed strategies and adapted my approach to ensure that I can contribute my best to life. I view this journey to be one of my greatest achievements.

Next I’d like to share my interest in creating, owning, and maintaining a community Discord server. Being a Discord creator and server owner is a fantastic hobby and a deep personal achievement for several reasons. Firstly, it allows me to exercise my creativity and vision by crafting a space that reflects my personal interests and values. It's like building a digital extension of myself, where I can curate content and discussions that resonate with me and bring together like-minded individuals who share my passions. 

Secondly, It’s like one big continuous learning experience. It’s required me to develop skills in moderation, organization, conflict resolution, community management, and fostering a positive atmosphere, which are not only valuable online but also in real-life scenarios.

The achievement for me stems from the impact I’ve had on the lives of my members. Seeing my server grow, witnessing friendships form, and knowing that I’ve created an environment for people to connect and share experiences is incredibly gratifying. It showcases my ability to enrich the online spaces I create and aligns with my core values of leaving a positive mark on the world.

It was not my intention when I set out in the beginning but now, I’d even go as far as to say being a Discord creator is not just a hobby, it now feels like a journey self-expression, growth, and making a meaningful impact, which is a remarkable personal achievement in today’s world.
